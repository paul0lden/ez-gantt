# Overview

Welcome to **ez-gantt**, a free and open-source React Gantt chart component, licensed under the **MIT License**. This lightweight and highly customizable component allows developers to easily create interactive, scalable, and visually appealing project management tools. With support for multi-window drag and drop, dynamic event height, and resize functionality, **ez-gantt** provides the flexibility needed to handle complex scheduling and resource management scenarios.

### Key Features
- **Open Source & Free**: ez-gantt is completely free to use and licensed under MIT, making it a great choice for both personal and commercial projects.
- **Customizable Event and Resource Rendering**: Define how events, resources, and headers are displayed using customizable slots, ensuring full control over the chart's appearance and behavior.
- **Precise Scheduling Control**: Manage scheduling thresholds, resource assignment modes, and drag-and-drop interactions to give users fine-tuned control over how tasks and resources are managed.
- **Scalable and Zoomable Views**: Configure different zoom levels for date ranges, from detailed hourly views to broader monthly or yearly overviews.
- **Multi-Window Drag and Drop**: ez-gantt supports multi-window drag-and-drop interactions, allowing users to seamlessly drag tasks across different windows or parts of the application.
- **Dynamic Event Height Support**: Adjust event height dynamically based on the data or resource complexity, providing a more flexible and adaptive timeline.
- **Event Resizing**: Enable users to resize tasks or events on the timeline, giving them intuitive control over scheduling changes directly on the chart.
- **Grid Layout Option**: Switch between grid and timeline layouts for displaying tasks and resources, making ez-gantt adaptable for different use cases.
- **Responsive & Interactive**: With full drag-and-drop support and custom preview options, users can interact with events and resources smoothly and intuitively.
  
### Multi-Event Type Model (Coming Soon)

The **multi-event type model API** is currently in development. This exciting feature will allow you to render different types of date-time data on the chart, such as:
- **No-Scheduling Areas**: Highlight sections where events cannot be scheduled, ensuring clear visual boundaries for unavailable times.
- **Drop Areas**: Define custom drop zones for events, enabling advanced task scheduling behavior or specific resource assignment areas.

This upcoming feature will add even more flexibility to ez-gantt, making it a powerful tool for complex scheduling applications.

### Customizable API

One of the greatest strengths of ez-gantt is its **fully customizable API**, providing granular control over every aspect of the Gantt chart:

- **Slot-Based Customization**: Use the `GanttSlots` API to inject your own components into the chart for:
  - **Custom Event Rendering**: Define how each event is visually represented, whether as tasks, milestones, or custom blocks.
  - **Resource Rendering**: Customize how resources are displayed, ensuring the Gantt chart matches your specific UI needs.
  - **Custom Headers**: Modify both time range and resource headers using `TimerangeHeader` and `ResourceHeader` slots to create unique timeline views.

- **Flexible Event and Resource Data**: Extend the `GanttEvent` and `GanttResource` types to manage any kind of additional data needed for your application. Whether you’re working with basic tasks, milestones, or complex multi-dimensional resources, ez-gantt provides the flexibility to handle them.

- **Drag-and-Drop Customization**: Fine-tune drag-and-drop behavior with custom previews and logic using `handleEventDrop` and `getDragPreview`. Control the interactions users have when moving events, rescheduling tasks, or assigning resources.

- **Resizable and Adaptive Event Heights**: Dynamically adjust event heights based on the amount of data, resource complexity, or visual requirements, providing a cleaner and more organized timeline.

- **Multi-Window Drag Support**: Allow users to drag events or resources across different browser windows, enhancing usability in multi-tasking or complex project management setups.

- **Custom Scheduling Logic**: Define complex scheduling logic with precise control over when and how events are scheduled, using `schedulingThreeshold`, and adapt your event drop resolution modes with `single-resource` or `as-selected`.

- **Time and Date Management**: Use the `DateViewLevel` interface to create custom time and date ranges, allowing for zoomable views that can range from hours to months or years. The `getLabel` method can be customized to display relevant information for each date range, along with customizable widths and colors.

### Rich Example Set

ez-gantt comes with a variety of **examples** showcasing different usage scenarios. These examples provide in-depth demonstrations of:
- **Tree Resource View**: Display resources in a hierarchical tree structure, useful for managing teams, machines, or other grouped resources.
- **Custom Event Types**: Show how different event types, such as tasks and milestones, can be represented and managed on the same timeline.
- **Dynamic Resizing and Drag-and-Drop**: Examples include how to implement resizing, drag-and-drop interactions, and more complex scheduling behaviors.

Head over to the [Examples](./examples.md) section to explore these use cases and see ez-gantt in action.

### Minimal Dependencies

ez-gantt is built to be lightweight and efficient, with only two dependencies:
- **React**: The core of ez-gantt, as it is a React-based component.
- **Atlaskit Pragmatic Drag and Drop**: This library is used to provide robust and customizable drag-and-drop functionality for managing events and resources interactively.

By keeping dependencies to a minimum, ez-gantt is easy to integrate into projects without introducing unnecessary bloat, while still offering a powerful feature set.
